## Technical requirements
<ol>
<li>Implement a separate client application - an electronic scoreboard that will show full information about the last orders (at least 10), their number will depend on your UI.</li>
<li>On the same screen, the summary information on drivers and trucks for the current month should be displayed. How many drivers are there, how many available / unavailable. How many trucks are there, how many are available / used on the order / out of order.</li>
<li>The data must be loaded at startup and stored on the client side. Data reloading is carried out in case of receiving a notification from the server.</li>
</ol>

## Project structure

Here we also have MVC structure, although the technology stack is different. 
So, JSF is used on frontend side, whereas, EJB are used to implement Model * Controller tiers.
